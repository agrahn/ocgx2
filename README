==================================


1. Introduction
===============

This package serves as a drop-in replacement for the already existing
packages `ocgx' by Paul Gaborit and `ocg-p' by Werner Moshammer for the
creation of PDF Layers.

It re-implements the functionality of the `ocg', `ocgx' and `ocg-p'
packages and adds support for all known engines and back-ends including:

  *  LaTeX --> dvips --> ps2pdf/Distiller
  *  (Xe)LaTeX --> (x)dvipdfmx
  *  pdfLaTeX, luaLaTeX

Also, it adds some minor improvements and bug fixes, such as package
options, remembering option settings of re-opened ocgs, correct behaviour
of layer switching links that were themselves placed on layers, correct
listing of (nested) ocgs in the layers tab of PDF viewers, compatibility
with the `animate' and `media9' packages.

To enable dvipdfmx support, pass `dvipdfmx' globally as a class option.

  * New features:

    +  PDF layers extending over page breaks
    +  grouping PDF layers into Radio Button Groups
    +  re-implementing `hyperref`'s `ocgcolorlinks` option for creating
       OCG coloured links, which are printed on paper in the default
       text colour and which can, unlike the original `hyperref'
       implementation, extend over line and page breaks. With
       pdfLaTeX/LuaLaTeX, OCG links can be nested.

Coloured OCG links are enabled with

  \usepackage{hyperref} % do NOT set [ocgcolorlinks] here!
  \usepackage[ocgcolorlinks]{ocgx2}

`ocgx2' uses code from file `tikzlibraryocgx.code.tex' by P. Gaborit to
enable TikZ styles for creating PDF Layers and clickable layer switching
links in the `tikzpicture' context.

Just say:

  \usepackage[tikz]{ocgx2}

instead of

  \usepackage{tikz}
  \usetikzlibrary{ocgx}

to enable these TikZ styles and read the `ocgx' documentation about
their usage:

  texdoc ocgx

The /tikz/ocg/opts=<ocg options> parameter adds to the list in section
`How to add TikZ scopes into OCGs' in the `ocgx' manual. It allows
passing ocg environment options (see below) to the TikZ scope.


2. Usage
========

\usepackage[<options>]{ocgx2}

\begin{ocg}[<options>]{<layer name>}{<layer id>}{<initial visibility>}
  ... material to be put on a PDF layer ...
\end{ocg}

With <initial visibility> = ( on | true | 1 )  |  ( off | false | 0 )

and <options> : viewocg = always | never | ifvisible
                printocg =  always | never | ifvisible
                exportocg =  always | never | ifvisible

    not in ocgx, ocg-p:

                showingui (to be preferred over `listintoolbar' of ocgx/ocg-p)
                radiobtngrp = <group name> (string; environment-only option)

                tikz  (package-only option, see above)
                ocgcolorlinks  (package-only option, see above)

Package options have global scope. Environment options override package
options locally.

Layers can be added to one or several Radio Button Groups using the new
option `radiobtngrp'. From all layers within a Radio Button Group only
one can be enabled at a time. Enabling a layer, e. g. in the Layers tab
of the PDF viewer, automatically hides the previously visible layer.
Option `radiobtngrp' can be used repeatedly for the same OCG in order
to add the layer to more than one Radio Button Group.

`ocg' environments can be nested and span multiple pages.

See the `ocg-p' manual about the environment usage and the meaning of
the remaining options:

  texdoc ocg-p

Clickable links for switching PDF layer visibility are created with:

  \switchocg{<layer IDs to toggle, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \showocg{<layer IDs to switch ON, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \hideocg{<layer IDs to switch OFF, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \actionsocg{<IDs to toggle>}{<IDs to switch ON>}{<IDs to switch OFF>}{<link text>}

For details about their usage, read the `ocgx' package manual:

  texdoc ocgx

For compatibility with the `ocg-p' package, the following commands have
been provided:

  \toggleocgs[triggerocg=...]{<layer IDs to toggle, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \showocgs[triggerocg=...]{<layer IDs to switch ON, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \hideocgs[triggerocg=...]{<layer IDs to switch OFF, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \setocgs[triggerocg=...]{<IDs to toggle>}{<IDs to switch ON>}{<IDs to switch OFF>}{<link text>}

See the `ocg-p' package manual for the meaning of `triggerocg=...'.

Breakable OCG coloured links work best with normal text as link text. If
the link text is mixed with graphical content, such as from external files or
inline graphics (e. g. TikZ) and even \fbox-ed text, these graphical parts must
be enclosed in

  \ocglinkprotect{...}

For example:

  \href{http://ctan.org}{Visit me on
                    \ocglinkprotect{\includegraphics{ctan-lion}}!}
