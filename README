==================================
 The `ocgx2' LaTeX Package

 Version 0.17 [2016/03/22]

==================================


1. Introduction
===============

This package serves as a drop-in replacement for the already existing
packages `ocgx' by Paul Gaborit and `ocg-p' by Werner Moshammer for the
creation of PDF Layers.

It re-implements the functionality of the `ocg', `ocgx' and `ocg-p'
packages and adds support for all known engines and back-ends including:

  *  LaTeX --> dvips --> ps2pdf/Distiller
  *  (Xe)LaTeX --> (x)dvipdfmx
  *  pdfLaTeX, luaLaTeX

To enable dvipdfmx support, pass `dvipdfmx' globally as a class option.

  * New features:

    +  layers extending across page breaks
    +  grouping layers into Radio Button Groups
    +  OCG coloured links for hyperref

Also, it adds some minor improvements and bug fixes, such as package
options, remembering option settings of re-opened ocgs, correct behaviour
of layer switching links that were themselves placed on layers, correct
listing of (nested) ocgs in the layers tab of PDF viewers, compatibility
with the `animate' and `media9' packages.

Coloured links in the PDF viewer that are printed on paper in the default text
colour are enabled with

  \usepackage{hyperref} % do NOT set [ocgcolorlinks] here!
  \usepackage[ocgcolorlinks]{ocgx2}

`ocgx2' uses code from file `tikzlibraryocgx.code.tex' by P. Gaborit to
enable TikZ styles for creating PDF Layers and clickable layer switching
links in the `tikzpicture' context.

Just say:

  \usepackage[tikz]{ocgx2}

instead of

  \usepackage{tikz}
  \usetikzlibrary{ocgx}

to enable these TikZ styles and read the `ocgx' documentation about
their usage:

  texdoc ocgx

The /tikz/ocg/opts=<ocg options> parameter adds to the list in section
`How to add TikZ scopes into OCGs' in the `ocgx' manual. It allows
passing ocg environment options (see below) to the TikZ scope.


2. Usage
========

\usepackage[<options>]{ocgx2}

\begin{ocg}[<options>]{<layer name>}{<layer id>}{<initial visibility>}
  ... material to be put on a PDF layer ...
\end{ocg}

With <initial visibility> = ( on | true | 1 )  |  ( off | false | 0 )

and <options> : viewocg = always | never | ifvisible
                printocg =  always | never | ifvisible
                exportocg =  always | never | ifvisible
                listintoolbar= always | never | iffirstuse

    not in ocgx, ocg-p:

                showingui (same as `listintoolbar')
                radiobtngrp = <group name> (string; environment-only option)

                tikz  (package-only option, see above)
                ocgcolorlinks  (package-only option, see above)

Package options have global scope. Environment options override package
options locally.

Layers can be added to one or several Radio Button Groups using the new
option `radiobtngrp'. From all layers within a Radio Button Group only
one can be enabled at a time. Enabling a layer, e. g. in the Layers tab
of the PDF viewer, automatically hides the previously visible layer.
Option `radiobtngrp' can be used repeatedly for the same OCG in order
to add the layer to more than one Radio Button Group.

`ocg' environments can be nested and span multiple pages.

See the `ocg-p' manual about the environment usage and the meaning of
the remaining options:

  texdoc ocg-p

Clickable links for switching PDF layer visibility are created with:

  \switchocg{<layer IDs to toggle, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \showocg{<layer IDs to switch ON, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \hideocg{<layer IDs to switch OFF, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \actionsocg{<IDs to toggle>}{<IDs to switch ON>}{<IDs to switch OFF>}{<link text>}

For details about their usage, read the `ocgx' package manual:

  texdoc ocgx

For compatibility with the `ocg-p' package, the following commands have
been provided:

  \toggleocgs[triggerocg=...]{<layer IDs to toggle, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \showocgs[triggerocg=...]{<layer IDs to switch ON, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \hideocgs[triggerocg=...]{<layer IDs to switch OFF, space separated>}{<link text>}
  \setocgs[triggerocg=...]{<IDs to toggle>}{<IDs to switch ON>}{<IDs to switch OFF>}{<link text>}

See the `ocg-p' package manual for the meaning of `triggerocg=...'.
